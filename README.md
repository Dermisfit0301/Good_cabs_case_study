# Good_cabs_case_study
This repository contains the comprehensive project for the Good Cabs Analysis Challenge, organized by Codebasics. It includes all necessary files, datasets, and SQL queries required to analyze and derive actionable insights. In this challenge, our role as a data analyst (Peter Pandey) is to assist the HOD (Tony Sharma) in delivering valuable insights to the Operations Head (Bruce Haryali) of Goodcabs.

Goodcabs, a service similar to Ola and Uber, focuses on tier-2 cities in India. Despite operating in ten cities, they have struggled to expand to other locations. To address this, they have sought our expertise to analyze key performance indicators such as customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and market trends.

This integrated project involves using SQL to extract and analyze business metrics and Power BI to create an interactive dashboard that provides insights for the leadership team to make informed decisions and steer the company toward growth in untapped tier-2 markets.
